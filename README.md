# Project Charter

## Business background
**Who is the client, what business domain the client is in?**<br>
Business clients in the field of real estate that use machine learning could include real estate agencies, property management companies, and real estate investment trusts (REITs).<br> These organizations may use machine learning to improve their operations and make more informed decisions.<br> For example, they may use machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of data on property values, rental rates, and market trends to predict the performance of different properties or to identify potential investment opportunities.<br> Machine learning may also be used to automate tasks such as analyzing property listings or identifying patterns in data that could indicate potential problems or opportunities.<br> Other potential applications for machine learning in the real estate industry include automating the process of identifying and evaluating properties for purchase or investment, predicting maintenance needs for properties, and analyzing customer preferences and behavior to tailor marketing efforts.<br>

Business clients in the field of insurance that use machine learning typically do so to improve their underwriting processes, fraud detection, and claims management.<br> By analyzing large amounts of data, insurance companies can build machine learning models that can identify patterns and trends that might not be immediately obvious to humans.<br> These models can then be used to make more accurate predictions about the likelihood of certain events occurring, such as the probability of a claim being filed or the likelihood of a policyholder experiencing a loss.<br> This can help insurance companies to make more informed decisions about which risks to insure and at what cost, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective operations.

## Scope
**What data science solutions are we trying to build?**<br>
As a solution to our research question, we aim to develop generic pipeline that will clean, preprocess and transform all data types.<br>
further more we wish to imporve our data with feature selection techniques and data resampling/reweighting in order to imporve our baselines.<br>
**What will we do?**   <br>

In our pipeline, we will also check the fairness of the model. The data we use for modeling is mostly a reflection of the real world, and the real world can be biased, so the data and therefore the model will likely reflect that bias. To check the fairness of the model, we will examine each feature of our dataset to see if it is biased by a subclass of that feature. For example, we might define a group based on the sex of the sample, and a subgroup based on age. We might then define the privileged subgroup as old males, who may be privileged in cases of house pricing.

To check for bias in each feature, we will use the Dalex package to measure fairness. If we detect unfairness, we will try one or both of the following options:

 - Reweighting the data: We will obtain weights for the model training pipeline and mitigate bias in statistical parity. This method will produce weights for the given subgroup for each class.

 - Resampling the data: We will return indices of observations for the data. Similar to reweighting, this method computes the desired number of observations as if the protected variable were independent of the outcome variable (y), and based on this, it determines if the subgroup with a certain class (favorable or not) should be more or less numerous. It then performs oversampling or undersampling, depending on the case.

By using one or both of these options, we can build a more balanced dataset for the model training pipeline.

We'll also use outliers detection and removal.
Outliers are data points significantly different from most of the other data points in a dataset.
The outlier's detection is performed per feature separately and is possible only in continuous values. If some feature of the data point is detected as an outlier, this data point will be determined as an outlier.
Once we have identified the outliers in our dataset, we will choose to remove them if they are causing problems with the predictions.
For example, removing outliers may be appropriate if they skew the results. However, we should be careful about removing outliers, as they may contain valuable information about our data.

So, we'll check whether removing the outliers improves results in the pipeline. 
There are a few different ways to identify and remove outliers from a dataset.

We'll examine two well-known methods for outliers' detection and use the one that will give us the best results: 
1. Z-score: The z-score measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean. If the z-score of a value is greater than a certain threshold (commonly 3 or 4), it can be considered an outlier.
2. Interquartile range (IQR): 
The IQR is a measure of the dispersion of a dataset and can be used to identify values that fall outside the range of "typical" values.
To calculate the quartiles of a dataset, we first need to arrange the values in numerical order.
Quartiles are values that divide a dataset into four equal parts. The first quartile (Q1) is the value that separates the lowest 25% of the data from the highest 75%. The second quartile, or median, is the value that separates the lowest 50% of the data from the highest 50%. The third quartile (Q3) is the value that separates the lowest 75% of the data from the highest 25%.

	So, we'll use the following formulas to calculate the quartiles:

	Q1 = (n+1) * (1/4)

	Median = (n+1) * (1/2)

	Q3 = (n+1) * (3/4)

	Where n is the number of values in the dataset.
	Outliers can then be identified as values that are more than x times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3.


**How is it going to be consumed by the customer?**<br>
To all of our cool customers, you can simply copy our pipeline implementation and run it in your environments.<br>
Playing with different pipeline params is advised !<br>

## Personnel
* **Data scientist (Daniel)** - A data scientist plays a crucial role in a project by using their skills in data
analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to extract valuable insights and knowledge from
data. They are responsible for collecting, cleaning, and organizing data from various sources, and
using this data to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to analyzing
data, a data scientist may also be involved in communicating their findings to stakeholders and
collaborating with other team members to implement data-driven solutions.<br>

* **Data Engineer (Yossi)** - A data engineer plays a crucial role in a project by building the
infrastructure to store, process, and analyze large amounts of data. They are responsible for
designing, building, maintaining, and optimizing data pipelines to facilitate the efficient flow of
data between systems. Data engineers work closely with data scientists and other team members to
understand the data needs of the project and to ensure that the data is structured and organized in a
way that is suitable for analysis.<br>
* **Project Lead (Jonathan)** - A project lead plays a crucial role in a project by providing direction,
leadership, and guidance to the team. They are responsible for managing the project from start to
finish, including setting project goals and objectives, developing a project plan, and ensuring that
the project is completed on time and within budget. The project lead works closely with team
members to delegate tasks, monitor progress, and address any issues or challenges that arise. They
also communicate with stakeholders, including clients, customers, and upper management, to keep
them informed of the project's progress and to address any concerns or feedback.<br>
* **Customer support (Guy)** - Customer support plays a crucial role in a project by providing assistance
and support to customers or users of the product or service being developed. They are responsible
for answering questions, troubleshooting issues, and helping customers to resolve problems.
Customer support team members may also be responsible for gathering feedback and suggestions
from customers, and providing this information to the project team to inform product development
and improvement. They may work closely with other team members, such as product managers and
developers, to ensure that customer needs and concerns are being addressed.
